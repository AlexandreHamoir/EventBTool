I assume that typing can be made arbitrarily smart, however
I do not yet know the limits of how much typing Rodin can do.

For sure both evbt and Rodin does explicit typing based on
statements like: `x∈N` `alfa∈N→BOOL` or `p∈STAFF`

But Rodin also does implicit typing based on operations. For example:

```
@inv1 alfa ∈ ℕ⇸BOOL
@inv2 beta ∩ ran(alfa) = ∅
```

The disjunction forces the type of beta to be the same as the type of ran(alfa) ie ℕ.

```
@inv3 x ∈ ℕ
@inv4 x+y=7
```

The addition forces Rodin the type of y to be ℤ (not ℕ!!)

This projects tests the extent of implicit typing implemented so far in evbt.
